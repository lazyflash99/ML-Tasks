task_1.ipynb

This notebook contains Level 1 to Level 4 of Task 1.
In level 1 I have tried to decode what Feature_1,feature_2 and feature_3 maybe.
In level 2 I have cleaned the data and further proceeded with the tasks.
In level 4 we have used logistic regression, decision trees and also random forest classifier and the random forest classifier gave the maximum accuracy.
